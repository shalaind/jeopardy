# Unit 1 Project - For The Culture - Early 2000's Edition 

**How To Play**
For The Culture is a trivia game based on the popular game show "Jeopardy". The objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible! The user will navigate through the gameboard and answer the prompts that appear accordingly. 

**User Story**
- As the user is on the home screen, they will choose if there are 1 or 2 players.
- After choosing the number of players, the user/users will enter their names and continue to the game board.
- Once the game board is visible, the user will be able to choose a category and pick a question from the column.
- Once a question is chosen, the user will be shown the question with an input box to answer the question.
- If the question is correct the user will be shown a screen that says their answer is correct and the amount of points they received. The user's score will be updated.

## Lessons I've Learned
- Throughout the course of this project I have a few takeways that I will apply to the future assignments. I believe having a set plan on how time will be managed on completing the project. I spent the majority of the time on figuring out the functionality and adding extra features to the point where I did'nt leave much time to implement the design. For future projects I will plan ahead of the time, the deadline I need to follow to meet certain objectives. 

## 2.0 features 
- I would like to add more animations and imagery that goes with the theme of the game
- I will make this game 2 players, in which each contestant can use a key that acts as a buzzer 
- I will make this game responsive
