**Lessons I've Learned**
Throughout the course of this project I have a few takeways that I will apply to the future assignments. I believe having a set plan on how time will be managed on completing the project. I spent the majority of the time on figuring out the functionality and adding extra features to the point where I did'nt leave much time to implement the design. For future projects I will plan ahead of the time, the deadline I need to follow to meet certain objectives.
